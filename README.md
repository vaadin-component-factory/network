## Usage
Create instance of `Network`. You can set scale, add/edit/delete nodes/edges.
You can also create component (group of nodes and edges).
You can navigate to a component when double-click. 

```
Network network = new Network();
network.setScale(2);
network.addNode(new NetworkNode("My Node"))
```

### Listeners

You can call Java function on events:
* on-select (nodes,edges)
* on-new-node (nodes to add)
* after-new-node (added nodes)
* on-update-node (nodes to update)
* on-delete-node (id of nodes to delete)
* after-delete-node (id of deleted nodes)
* on-hover-node (node hovered)
* on-new-edge (edges to add)
* after-new-edge (added edges)
* on-update-edge (edges to update)
* on-delete-edge (id of edges to delete)
* after-delete-edge (id of deleted edges)
* on-hover-edge (edge hovered)
* on-create-component (id of selected nodes)

Example:
```
Network<NetworkNodeImpl, NetworkEdgeImpl> network = new Network<>(NetworkNodeImpl.class,NetworkEdgeImpl.class);
network.setWidthFull();
addAndExpand(network);

network.addNetworkSelectionListener(event -> {
    Notification.show("Nodes selected "+ event.getNetworkNodes());
    Notification.show("Edges selected "+ event.getNetworkEdges());
});
```

## Custom editor for Node

You can customize node properties and create your own editor in Java (See CustomEditorView):

```
private Network<CustomNetworkNode, CustomNetworkEdge> network = new Network<>(CustomNetworkNode.class,CustomNetworkEdge.class);
network.setWidthFull();
addAndExpand(network);
network.addNodeEditor(new CustomNetworkNodeEditorImpl());
```
